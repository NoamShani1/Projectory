# How we would improve next time

Throughout the development process, several areas for improvement were identified:

## Database Planning: 
Better outlining of the database structure before development to view the system holistically and avoid restructuring later in the process.

## Class & ERM Diagrams: 
Creating Class and Entity-Relationship Model (ERM) diagrams earlier in the project would have provided a clearer visual aid and blueprint for development.

## Feature Completion: 
The project currently lacks the ability to add and edit projects, which is a crucial component. Finishing this feature would greatly enhance the functionality of the application.

## Time Management: 
More structured planning and task delegation could improve workflow efficiency and ensure timely completion of key features.
