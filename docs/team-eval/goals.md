# Goals achieved and missed

Reflecting on the project, the goal was to develop a fully functional application that could be deployed for real-world use. Several aspects were successfully achieved:

A structured framework for project showcasing was implemented, Users can add skills, Information, and upload their CV and display it all on their profile - a key aspect of the application.

The system was designed to support user authentication and profile management.

The foundation for database management and user interactions was established.

Documentation was created to guide future development and reference.

However, some key goals remain incomplete:

Certain core features, such as adding and editing projects, were not fully implemented.

Security measures could be further enhanced.

UI/UX refinement was left as an improvement for future iterations.

The project successfully laid a solid groundwork, but additional effort is needed to reach full functionality and deployment readiness.
