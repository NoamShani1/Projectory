## [team member] - review 1

### My observation (Wahrnehmung)

Good thinking and communication in terms of a view as a consumer and product owner & easily available. However, was unable to work on code earlier and ended up leaving the project, transferring a great workload to me.

### Effect on me (Wirkung)

While the beginning gave a good and structured overview of the project, the technical translation of it left me to complete it by myself in order to get it done within a timely manner to respect the deadline - resulting in an unexpected workflow.

### Tip for the future (Wunsch)

Earlier communication of current capacities for this project, and an earlier hands-on approach from both parties.
