## The problem

The problem this project focuses on is the presentation of projects in the CV. CVs in the PDF format is not the ideal way to show software or design projects. Young applicants in particular with little or no professional experience can only convince with projects. Existing solutions are not designed for this problem, they offer so many functions, that the focus is not on the applicant.

## Our solution

We offer a minimalistic page for presenting the applicant and their projects. It is intuitive to use for both applicant and employer. It provides a quick overview and allows you to be redirected to detailed pages.

## Target user

Our target users are students with low professional experience and a focus on project. On the other hand we have to consider employers in HR
