## The problem

Projectory addresses the challenge of effectively showcasing projects within a CV. Traditionally, applicants are forced to either attach an additional portfolio, which often gets overlooked, or limit their applications to the constraints of a standard CV.

Classic PDFs are not the ideal format for presenting software, design, or other creative projects, especially in the job market of the late 2010s and 2020s. Young applicants, particularly those with little or no professional experience, have a better chance of securing jobs or freelance opportunities by showcasing their projects and demonstrating hands-on skills, even without traditional work experience, which is often still a barrier to career advancement.

Existing solutions fail to address this issue effectively. They tend to offer an overwhelming number of features, shifting the focus away from the applicant rather than highlighting their skills and projects in a streamlined, accessible manner.

## Our solution

We offer a minimalist page for presenting applicants skills and their projects in one go. It is intuitive for both applicants and employers, providing a quick overview and allowing users to upload personal information, skills, a CV, and projects with an image and a description.

Projectory features a username-based search function, enabling people to access and view profiles without the need to log in or sign up. This is ideal for contractors and recruiters, as it streamlines the profile viewing process.

## Target user

Our target users are students with little professional experience or freelancers in various industries who want to showcase their projects alongside their information in a simple manner. On the other hand, we must also consider the recipients of a user's Projectory page, such as HR employers, freelance contractors, or recruiters in different fields.
